# BBC Micro:bit & Cutebot Code Club Roadmap 2025/6

This roadmap outlines approximately 20 weeks of 30-minute sessions for a Year 5/6 coding club. By the end of the year, students will design and code a **controller** and **race car** using BBC Micro:bit, Cutebot, and MakeCode.

---

## **Learning Goals**
By the end of the year, students will:
- Understand key programming concepts: variables, conditionals, loops, events.
- Use MakeCode to code Micro:bits and control Cutebots.
- Create a working wireless controller + race car.
- Test, debug, and refine their code.

## **Weekly Plan**

| Week | Topic / Focus | Key Skills | Activity / Project |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| **1** | Introduction & Setup | MakeCode basics, inputs/outputs | Setup devices, simple "Hello World" on Micro:bit. |
| **2** | Buttons & Gestures | Input events (button press, shake) | Show icons or numbers based on buttons or shake. |
| **3** | Motors, Lights, Sound | Cutebot motors, LEDs, buzzer | Move forward/back, turn, light up, make sound. |
| **4** | Variables | Storing data, speed control | Press A/B to adjust and display speed. |
| **5** | Conditionals | `if` / `else`, comparisons | Change behavior if speed > threshold or input detected. |
| **6** | Loops | `repeat`, `forever`, loops with conditionals | Blink LEDs, repeat motion patterns. |
| **7** | Sensors | Using sensors like light or ultrasonic | React to light or proximity sensor readings. |
| **8** | Radio Basics | Wireless communication | Send "Hello" between two Micro:bits. |
| **9** | Controller & Receiver Messaging | Send strings/numbers | Send commands: forward, back, left, right. |
| **10** | Motors via Radio | Combine radio + movement | Car moves based on controller messages. |
| **11** | Speed & Steering | Variables + radio | Add speed levels and steering to controls. |
| **12** | Debugging & Functions | Bug fixing, modular code | Use custom blocks for cleaner code. |
| **13** | Timing & Sequences | `pause`, timed loops | Create timed movement patterns. |
| **14** | Sensors + Movement | Sensor feedback | Obstacle avoidance or line following. |
| **15** | Full Prototype Build | Combine all features | Test controller + car on simple track. |
| **16** | Safety & Feedback | Fail-safes, LEDs, sounds | Car stops safely if no signal or invalid input. |
| **17** | Obstacle Course Challenge | Integration & application | Teams test their cars on a course. |
| **18** | Advanced Features | Extensions like tilt control | Optional features: gesture steering, lap counter. |
| **19** | Final Build & Refinement | Polish and debug | Final code and test runs. |
| **20** | Showcase & Reflection | Presentation skills | Race day + reflection on learning. |

## **Key Concepts Reinforced**
- **Events vs Sequential Code:** Understanding event-driven programming (`on button pressed`, `on radio received`).
- **Modular Code:** Creating custom blocks in MakeCode to keep code organized.
- **Debugging:** Strategies for testing and fixing problems.
- **Wireless Communication:** Reliable sending/receiving with radio groups and messages.
- **Iteration:** Building, testing, and improving projects step-by-step.

---

## **Project Mapping**
- **Weeks 1-7:** Learn basics of Micro:bit, Cutebot, and programming.
- **Weeks 8-11:** Build the wireless controller and communication system.
- **Weeks 12-14:** Add complexity like sensors, error handling, and custom features.
- **Weeks 15-20:** Focus on testing, polishing, and final showcase.
