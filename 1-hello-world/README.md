# Lesson 1: Hello World!
# Introduction to the BBC micro:bit

Welcome to your first step into the world of **coding** and **electronics**! 🎉  
The **BBC micro:bit** is a small, powerful computer that you can use to **create fun projects**, **learn programming**, and **understand how technology works**.

---

## 🖥️ What is a BBC micro:bit?
The BBC micro:bit is a **tiny computer** with lots of cool features, including:
- **LED display** (25 small lights to show text, numbers, and images)
- **Buttons** (A and B for interaction)
- **Sensors** (like a thermometer, compass, and motion detector)
- **Bluetooth** (to connect to other devices like your phone or tablet)
- **Pins** (to connect extra parts like lights, motors, and speakers)

It fits in the palm of your hand and is super easy to use.

## 🚀 What can you do with a micro:bit?
Here are some fun projects you can make:
- A **step counter** to count how many steps you take
- A **digital dice** for board games 🎲
- A **temperature monitor** 🌡️
- A **simple game** like Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊✋✌️
- Control **robots** or **lights** with code! 🤖💡

## 🛠️ The core functions
Here are the most important things you can do with your micro:bit:
- **Show messages** on the LED screen  
  Example: display the words "Hello World!"
- **Detect button presses** (A or B)
- **Use sensors** to detect motion or temperature
- **Connect to other devices** using Bluetooth

We'll start with the basics, like making the micro:bit **say hello**.
